# node-chat

WIP

## Motivation
Let's build a complex chat backend system! I've always been passionate about complex backend systems and distributed services and so this provides the perfect excuse to build such a system and refresh my devops skills.

Goals:

- NodeJS API.
- Realtime with websockets.
- Message queuing and distribution with rabbitMQ.
- Containarize with docker and store it in ECS.
- Serve it with EC2, begind an ALB with auto-scaling.
